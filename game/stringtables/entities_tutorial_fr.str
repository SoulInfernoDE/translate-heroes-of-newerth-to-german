// Hero_PyromancerTutorial
Hero_PyromancerTutorial_name											Pyromancer
Hero_PyromancerTutorial_description										For centuries, the Sacred Order has recognized the "Flame-Touched," those men and women filled with a burning, if more than slightly mad, devotion to Sol.  Those Flame-Touched who serve in the Legion are more commonly called PyromancerTutorials for their mastery over fire, and creatures strongly attuned to that element.
Hero_PyromancerTutorial_role											The PyromancerTutorial is a spike magic damage dealer that can incinerate an enemy within seconds by using his three damage spells in quick succession. Because his Dragonfire stun is delayed on cast, he is best paired with another hero with a ranged stun.
