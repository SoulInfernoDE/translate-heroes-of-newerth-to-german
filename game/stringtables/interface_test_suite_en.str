If the modifier is none of the above it most likely is coming from another entity (such as an ability/item).
test_server_modifiers2_tip		Type the name of the modifier you want to add here.\n\nSet Active will make the given modifier the active modifier on the entity (you can only have one active modifier).\n\nAdd Persistent will add the modifier to the entity.\n\nNote: Clear modifiers will only clear modifiers on the entity, it will not clear modifiers from other entities/tools or global modifiers.
test_server_states_tip			Allows viewing the states on the currently selected entity as well as information about each state.\n\nYou can also apply/remove a state onto any entity/group of entities.

test_client_audit_resource_tip		Checks that all resources required by the given entity exist and successfully load.\n\nEnabling Show Res Chains will also print out the chains of entities/resources that leads to a broken resource. The entities listed as part of the chain may also directly load a resource, not just the bottom most entity (for example an ability that applies a state, where both entities use the ability icon).\n\nNote: If resources have previously been loaded and have not been unloaded (either by the UI or by entering a game) the results from this audit may be incorrect! It's best to run this test on a freshly started client.
test_client_audit_resources_tip		Checks that all resources required by entities exist and successfully load.\n\nEnabling Show Res Chains will also print out the chains of entities/resources that leads to a broken resource. The entities listed as part of the chain may also directly load a resource, not just the bottom most entity (for example an ability that applies a state, where both entities use the ability icon).\n\nNote: This can take a long time (10s of minutes) to run for some reports as each relevant entity must be loaded, each resource checked, and then unloaded. Enabling Res Chains may significantly increase the run time as the process for creating the relationship graphs between entities and resources is complicated and expensive.\n\nNote 2: If resources have previously been loaded and have not been unloaded (either by the UI or by entering a game) the results from this audit may be incorrect! It's best to run this test on a freshly started client.
test_client_audit_usage_tip			Loads all resources used by an entity and reports its memory usage.\nEnabling 'Show Resources' will print the path and details for measurable resources.\n\nNote: This will under report the actual usage becase we currently only track/measure sound and texture usage.\n\nNote 2: If resources have previously been loaded and have not been unloaded (either by the UI or by entering a game) the stats from this audit may be inaccurate! It's best to run this test on a freshly started client.

It's best to run this test on a freshly started client.

test_client_mount_world				Mounted World
test_client_mount_world_tip			This drop-down selects which map is 'mounted'. This will effect the resource and usage tests as entities in the map will be used in place of normal entities (in the resource files).

test_client_fake_plinko_tip			Fakes a Plinko drop using the given information. Providing a number for the tickets field will result in the drop producing tickets, leave the value empty if you want a product.\n\nNote: You should fill the fields with information from the admin panel (this is faking a response from web).
test_client_fake_bag_tip			Fakes a grab bag purchase using the given information. Products that do not have a name provided will not be included in the grab bag (so if the bag should only have one product, only fill out info for one product).\n\nNote: You should fill the fields with information from the admin panel (this is faking a response from web).
test_client_time_offset_tip			Takes a unix timestamp to set the local server time. 5 hours will be subtracted from this time to change it from UTC to EST when making time checks.
test_client_product_list_tip 		Allows searching and looking up information in the product list your client currently has. The information boxes are editable so that they can be copied from, changing them has no impact.\n\nNote: Much of this information is not used on the client, and it's possible it could be out of date as the product list is only updated on login.
