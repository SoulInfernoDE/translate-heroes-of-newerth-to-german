Item_Sicarius_shop_flavor										Slash is an assassin's dagger that gives one the agility and attacking speed to inflict quick, accurate blows, and the movement speed to escape afterwards.

Item_Intelligence7_shop_flavor									Those most immersed in the secret arts of Newerth, Man and Beast alike, bear a winged Staff of the Master as a mark of their rank.

Item_Lightning1_ATTACK_effect:chainlightningproc				20% chance to cast chain lightning, dealing 150 Magic damage to your attack target and two additional nearby enemies.

Item_Morph_description											When activated, applies Transfigure to enemy target for 3.5 seconds.
Item_Morph_effect_header										Transfigured Effects
Item_Morph_shop_flavor											Few shamanic implements are as unnerving as Totems of Kuldra: living, speaking, writhing staves that impart wisdom, strength, and speed and help their masters tap into the hidden flows of Mana and thus restore their power more speedily.

Item_WhisperingHelm_shop_flavor									Whispering Helms are gifts from the Hellbourne to their corrupted lieutenants.
