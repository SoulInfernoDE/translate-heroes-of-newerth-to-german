However there are those who leave the marsh, sometimes by choice, but most times by force. Bushwack is a hunter that has been living on his own for years. Ostracized from his tribe at a young age for tampering with the technology of an abandoned Dwarven village. Considered to be bad voodoo by the tribal elders, such interactions with the strange machinery was not only forbidden but punishable by exile. Bushwack pleaded with the elders saying that it is foolish to not use the power of one of their greatest foes, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. So he parted ways with his people in order to pursue his passions.  Now he is one of the most feared hunters of the southern parts of Death's Cradle, using his troll cunning and dwarven ingenuity, to eliminate foes from great distances. Even though he works alone he is steadfast in the protection of his home and has aligned himself with the Helbourne who are also enemies of the Dwarves. Meeting the Electrician and Dr. Repulsor cemented his belief that the only way for his people to survive in these changing times is through harnessing technology, and leaving the voodoo behind.
Hero_Bushwack_role												Bushwack is a ranged agility carry who excels at kiting through quick movement and positioning. Between Crippling Dart and Side Step, Bushwack can keep his enemies in range, and Jungle Toxin keeps them from juking away.

Hero_Calamity_description										Sister Arete of the Sacred Order believed Sol had set her upon a path to be King Jeraziah's Queen and provide him with an heir. When she finally mustered the courage to forsake her vows and present herself to the king, Jeraziah accused her of being a daemon herself, trying to tempt him into the sin that would cast his soul down to be condemned by The Three Judges of All and forever imprisoned by the dragon guardian Sunder. Devastated, Sister Arete gorged on poison and damned her own soul. This is what she wanted. The Three Judges sent her to face Sunder, who hoards the souls within the Vault of All Hells, where she used her mastery of the dark arts to make the fearsome guardian her pet. Now she has become Calamity, breaking open the doors of hell and unleashing an endless stream of tortured souls upon Newerth. But she cares not about this. She will kill every one of Jeraziah's advisors, soldiers—even his savage sister—until only he is left standing, and then she will stand beside him, ruling the Third Corruption together.
Hero_Calamity_role												Calamity is a fragile magic damage powerhouse who relies on positioning and finesse for her abilities to land. With the ability to siphon stats and movement speed from enemy heroes with Funeral Pyre and displace them with Firebomb, she's able to keep them at bay for her Dragon's Path and Sunder's Vault to hit.

He had forsaken all hope when his long-lost wife, Reena, appeared next to him--she was next in line for the slaughter. Eckol found hope again, and courage. He fought to save Reena and escape the prison camp just as Calamity shattered Newerth closer to the Third Corruption. Reena was consumed by the spreading evil and pulled into the underworld while Eckol was torn apart by shrapnel and cursed with the power to raise the dead. He gathered the molten scraps of metal and used them to hold his ruined body together, vowing to fill the underworld with souls until he found Reena once again.
Hero_Deadlift_role												Deadlift is a melee teamfighter that specializes in bringing back dead units with his Resurrection ability. Using Onslaught, Deadlift is capable of devastating both heroes and structures, while Soul Syphon grants him bonus health whenever a nearby unit falls in battle.

Hero_DoctorRepulsor_description									The storied professor of archaeology had never been content. The earth was full of artifacts; artifacts that held secrets to the prior lives of men. Science, psychology, sociology... the forgotten vices of man and the primal tenets of the Hellbourne, poured into the professor as he absorbed the forbidden knowledge and was consumed. Devoid of free will, he is now a slave to the power he once coveted.
Hero_DoctorRepulsor_role										The most mobile hero in the game, Doctor Repulsor is also one of the most reviled for his ability to constantly shift his position with Ludicrous Speed. However, mana is a neverending issue for him, so a large mana pool and mana regeneration boosted by items are musts.

At first apathetic to the Hellbourne threat, the Drunken Master leapt to action when a wise sage explained to him that should the Hellbourne overrrun Newerth, there would be no more booze. Armed with expert combat techniques and fueled by questionable substances, the Drunken Master embodies that which is unpredictable and unyielding.

Hero_FlintBeastwood_name										Flint Beastwood
Hero_FlintBeastwood_description									For years, the Beasts told of a twisted man-thing that stalked them through the Rulian marshes, leaving a trail of corpses in his wake. The humans dubbed him "Flint Beastwood" -- playing on his flint-lock firearms and his residence in the Beasts' forests. Fast to draw, fast to kill, fast to laugh about the deed, Flint has now spread his carnage beyond the marshes to wherever he can find the Legion.
Hero_FlintBeastwood_role										With the longest range in the game, Flint Beastwood can unleash pain on faraway opponents with a combination of Flare and auto-attacks, while Money Shot allows him to pick off escaping heroes. His only weakness is his low survivability.

Hero_Geomancer_description										As the murder, atrocity, and sin intensified during Man's Fall from Light, the primordial Geomancers began to stir deep beneath the surface of the Hivelands. They tunneled toward the suffering with scores of daemons crowding behind, anxious to harvest and feed. "Across the world, great ruptures arose, like sores upon the land. Those left to quiver in the darkness called them gates to Hell. And Hell, from them, emerged." Rithe the Geomancer burst through a sacrificial shrine and was the first to taste the flesh of Moon Queen's brood, and he was the last to return to the depths of the underworld when food and souls became scarce and the agony had quelled. For many years he feasted on the blood and pain of those who had been taken during the First Corruption. When Maliken Grimm, King of Newerth, fled into the wilderness and began his descent into madness, Rithe and the Geomancers stirred once again.
Hero_Geomancer_role												Geomancer is a ganker and area-of-effect team fighter with a variety of crowd control and disable abilities. However, because of how unreliable his skill shots are, he is best paired with more reliable disablers.

A trail of blood and devastation marked Myrmidon's escape to the ranks of the Hellbourne.  Now, wielding the destructive might of a tsunami, he wreaks havoc among those who once claimed him as an ally.

The golem made from magnetized stone and steel was complete and ready to be brought to life. He watched as Hellbringer completed the ritual to summon forth the demon that would power the construct and bring it to life. The Eldritch runes etched into its frame would hold the creature eternally in place. While it may lack the intelligence of Chronos, the new soldier would be the first of many demon powered war machines.

His prowess in battle allows him to increase the damage of his allies as well as his own.

Hero_Maliken_description										Once the greatest defender of mankind and lord over the entire Legion, Maliken walked too close to the darkness and was claimed by it.  Now he is nothing more than a slave among the damned -- but his incredible might has only grown in his downfall.  Wielding a damned sword fed by his own damned soul, Maliken is the bane of the very heroes he once led into battle.
Hero_Maliken_role												Maliken is a strong initiator and late game damage dealer with a Sword Throw and Possession combo. Because Hellbourne Zeal makes Maliken attack faster as he loses health, playing Maliken requires the player to carefully manage his survival. A Shrunken Head will increase his survivability greatly.

Hero_Martyr_description											Few clergy of Sol burn with such brilliance that they may ascend to the highest orders of priesthood. Even fewer dare gift their own souls to the Legion, braving an eternity in damnation so that others may prosper in turn. The few who do earn the forsaken title of the Martyr, wielding a battle-ready relic in one hand and carrying the Codex Solaris in the other. To certain death they march; and some say, with more fervor than those who march towards life.
Hero_Martyr_role												Martyr is a support hero who's all about brinkmanship. Knowing exactly how much enemies can deal and what you can take and dish out at all times is key to playing a successful Martyr. Unlike some supports, Martyr scales well with tank items, and can be a big threat if left unchecked. A combination of healing, health swing, and protective skills makes Martyr a versatile and dangerous support.

Hero_Pearl_description											For eons, the Bubble Magi were the greatest defense the Legion had against the Beasts and Demons. Their protective magic circled the Legion cities in domes that kept the enemy assaults at bay. When Maliken betrayed the Legion, his agents simultaneously assassinated every Bubble Mage known to the Legion and burned their monasteries to the ground. All of them... save for one lone apprentice who was mistaken for a mere servant and one pet turtle who had watched his master from afar. Searching among the ruins of her home, she discovered her master's staff still clutched in his charred hands. As she took up his weapon, she finally allowed her tears to flow and her determination became clear. She has spent years honing her craft and now Pearl, the last known Bubble Mage, has taken to the battlefields to bring vengeance down upon Maliken and his demon horde.
Hero_Pearl_role													Pearl is a ranged intelligence support hero that protects and heals nearby allies while knocking enemies away. Unlike other support heroes, Pearl wants to be in the midst of the battle, ready to stop damage with Preservation or knock enemies away with Whirlbubble.

Hero_Predator_name												Predator
Hero_Predator_description										With huge, lance-like claws of solid bone emerging from their forearms, and spikes fit to impale the strongest foe spread across their hard shell, Predators seem more like daemons than Beasts. The men who fight beside them look at them with recollected fear from the days the Predators hunted humans, not daemons.  But the hunger, speed, and rage they bring to bear against the Hellbourne are a welcome boon.
Hero_Predator_role												In a one-on-one battle, Predator beats nearly all other damage dealers due to the scaling life leech from Carnivorous. Despite his focus on a single target, Terror is one of the most powerful armor debuffs in the game, allowing him great synergy with other Physical Damage dealers.

Hero_Prophet_description										There are those who take a different path to power, one of pacts and binding. These are not the infernal pacts of the Deamons, but instead they are made with the forces that oppose the chaos the Hellbourne bring. The creatures of the world and the forces of life, death, and nature themselves all wish to have their say in the fate of Newerth. To ensure the Hellbourne are driven back into the pits from which they spawned, each will empower an avatar to fight on their behalf, a Prophet to ensure that fate favors the bold. Although the pacts started out as noble, the Prophet did not realize that Raven is a trickster and his pacts come at a cost. The power that the Prophet wielded was more than any one man should taste, and soon he craved more. The only way to achieve such levels of power was the sacrifice of others and when the Legion discovered this wickedness, the Prophet was marked for retribution. He escaped to join the ranks of the Hellbourne where his prophecies can be cast without regard for life or morality.
Hero_Prophet_role												Prophet is an extremely versatile ranged intelligence hero. His strengths lay in his early laning harassment as well as his teamfight presence. A well placed Shared Fate can alter any teamfight in Prophet's Favor!

Hero_PuppetMaster_name											Puppet Master
Hero_PuppetMaster_description									Although all the daemons of the Hellbourne ranks are terrifying, few deserve to be called "creepy."  Yet that is the best word for the Puppet Master, whose smirks and gibbers and cackles of glee bespeak not just the specter of death, but something worse.  His puppets are offenses to life -- either false things imbued with stolen life, or living things twisted to his will.
Hero_PuppetMaster_role											The Puppetmaster's combination of incredible Attack Damage and powerful single target disables make him difficult to escape, but lack of survivability make items vital. Late game, a cast of Puppet Show on an enemy damage dealer can be disastrous for the opposing team.

But then she ran into Slither, who poisoned her fans there and hither, she could no longer bear it, so she did so swear it. She pledged her life to the Legion cause, took Jeraziah as her boss, who consoled Rhapsody for her loss, and vowed to be at her side.

Hero_Riptide_description										The creature known as Riptide was the finest captain of the Legion's Armada, and any who questioned her ability due to gender would find it hard to continue their insults with a slit throat. Her ship, The Mermaid's Wrath, was sailing upon calm waters when the sea began to swirl and churn. The Maw was hungry. The Mermaid's Wrath and her entire crew were lost to the whirlpool, and as soon as the top castle disappeared the waters returned to serenity. But below the surface, these fine sailors and their captain were just beginning the endless torture of The Maw. Their lungs were filled with its icy waters, which had a terrible, undeniable consciousness, and their bodies were broken, battered, and reformed in the undertow. When the Second Corruption occurred and all of Newerth shook, The Maw released Riptide to serve as a protector of the deep, imbued with additional strength whenever she feels the cold comfort of water, and to deliver the most skilled warriors of Newerth back to the abyss. If the shape-shifting Riptide is any indication of what will become of them, it is best for everyone to stay out of the river.

After the alliance with the Beast Horde, they learned yet more ways of the wild, and turned all their craft to defeating the Hellbourne.  Though many view them as aloof, none doubt the importance of Scouts in the war against the daemons, as the countless enemy corpses, dead by a single blow, attest.
Hero_Scout_role													The Scout is one of the fastest and most elusive heroes in the game when Vanished, while Electric Eyes are perfect for intelligence and counter-intelligence. When the Scout obtains enough damage items, he can output a huge amount of spike Physical Damage.

Vorax also gains ^o2 Attack Damage, 0.3 Armor and 20 Max Health per game minute elapsed when spawned^*.\n\nVorax appears on the mini-map to both teams, and provides 200 day and night vision to both allies and enemies.\n\nVorax will attack any enemy that comes within 150 units, but will otherwise disregard attacks against him. Every 10 seconds, Vorax uses Rock Smash to throw a boulder at the furthest enemy hero, dealing Vorax's current attack damage and applying a ^otapering 75% Movement Speed Slow^* for 2 seconds. If within 600 units of a structure, Vorax will focus his attention solely on that structure, ^oDisarming it^* and dealing ^o1/12 of his Max Health as True Damage to himself^* on each attack. Vorax kills creeps in one hit.\n\nIf not killed within 3 minutes, Vorax will retreat from the battlefield. Vorax gives {100,150,200} gold and {100,150,200} experience when slain, but none if he kills himself. More than one Vorax cannot be active at the same time per Skrap. Skrap only gains 65% Gold Bounty when Vorax kills a creep & is more than 1500 units away from Vorax.

Hero_Skrap_description											Skrap is a cunning scavenger from the Seradati Plains who once roamed the desolate landscape gathering carrion to feed himself and occasionally sell in the rare event he encountered another living thing. Now he hoards every daemon carcass he can find to nourish his destructive, ravenous pet Vorax in the war against the Hellbourne. Skrap prefers to skulk along the edges of combat, harassing the enemy and harvesting their remains until he has enough to feed the Vorax, who revels in charging forward and demolishing everything in its path.

As children of the Moon Goddess, the rays of Sol burn their flesh, forcing them to construct a vessel to channel Lunari's might during the day. The magicks used were so potent that only a chosen warrior, born in perfect balance between light and darkness, could harness its vast power by being forever bonded to her armor. In the night, the chosen can retake her true form and strike from the shadows, free from her confining shell. Be it through strength by day or stealth by night, Solstice, the Lady of Lunari, stands ready to show her enemies what power truly is.

Hero_Vanya_name													The Dark Lady
Hero_Vanya_description											Wielding twin, scythe-like blades, the she-reaper known as the Dark Lady has moved through the Legion's ranks like a shadow of death.  For soldiers seeking to buck up their courage, she is a punch-line: "Careful you don't find the Dark Lady," they joke to their carousing friend.  But even these jokes are accompanied by a shudder.  Swift and cold and lethal as the frozen winds off the steps, black as the cloud-choked night, she is no laughing matter.
Hero_Vanya_role													The Dark Lady is a late game powerhouse with an exponential power growth, but is highly dependent on proper early and mid-game support. Once she has amassed enough wealth, her Dark Blades and Charging Strikes allow her to burst down entire waves of enemies.
