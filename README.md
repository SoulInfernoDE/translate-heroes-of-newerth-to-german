Files to be translated using github


If you want to help with this translation:

- please download git if you dont have it already
- login to git on your cli and set the global login with:
git config --global user.email my@email.here

git config --global user.name mygitusername

- Clone this repository
Move to your folder where you want to save a copy of the translation files and do:
git clone https://github.com/SoulInfernoDE/translate-heroes-of-newerth-to-german.git

- Go to https://github.com/SoulInfernoDE/translate-heroes-of-newerth-to-german/issues
- Open a issue and ask for a collaborator entry (I'll add you then)
- Now change the translation files (Edit them with Notepad++ for example or XED or your favourite editor!)
If you are ready with your changed files do a commit and a push. Then we merge the translation and i will also create a 'Deutsch.honmod' file.
