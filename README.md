Files to be translated using github


If you want to help with this translation:

- please download git if you dont have it already
- login to git on your cli and set the global login with:

git config --global user.email my@email.here

git config --global user.name mygitusername


- Clone this repository:

Move to your folder where you want to save a copy of the translation files and do:

git clone https://github.com/SoulInfernoDE/translate-heroes-of-newerth-to-german.git


- Go to https://github.com/SoulInfernoDE/translate-heroes-of-newerth-to-german/issues

- Open a issue and ask for a collaborator entry (I'll add you then)

- Now change the translation files (Edit them with Notepad++ for example or XED or your favourite text editor!)

If you are ready with your changed files do a commit and a push. Then we merge the translation and i will also create a
updated 'Deutsch.honmod' file which can be updated through the Mod Manager.

You can also edit the files directly on github and create a commit/pull request. Do NOT remove any spaces between the variable/command fields
at the left side and the translated text fields.

On Github:
- Goto the game/stringtable folder
- Click any file that ends with _de.str
- Press the edit button (Stift/pencil)
- Translate the english entrys and save/commit/pull/merge
- If its not possible to save then do a FORK first which copies everything to your own github account
- then edit the files, save and create a commit/pull request to my branch
